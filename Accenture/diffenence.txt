WebSocket provides a persistent full-duplex client-server connection over TCP, mainly used for real-time messaging and notifications, WebSocket is simpler and server-based,. 
WebRTC enables peer-to-peer real-time communication using UDP and supports native audio, video, and data channels with built-in NAT traversal and encryption, WebRTC is more complex and optimized for low-latency media streaming.
